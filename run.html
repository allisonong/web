								In 2020 I became a couch potato. I decided to get back in shape by running and listening to all the albums on Rolling Stones magazines list of the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/">500 Greatest Albums of all Time</a>. I also decided to learn to code and make a website where I write about the music and my running. Welcome!

							<p>
								When the Coronavirus Pandemic hit Seattle in March 2020, I was training for a half marathon and looking forward to a summer of outdoor adventures. Of course, my race was cancelled, as were many of the outdoor adventures. Thus began a year of relative isolation and living and working from the same desk. It was an emotional rollercoaster, but one of the best things about 2020 was the new music I discovered and the way that music calmed me and gave me back the excitement that was missing in most parts of my life. In October I decided to use music to motivate myself to exercise and go outside again. I love music, and I hate running. But running is the cheapest, easiest, and most efficient way to get in shape. I also like learning new skills, so I decided I would learn to code and write a website myself. So, this project is a resolution to keep listening to new music, get in shape, and learn a new skill. 
							</p>
							<h3>Rules</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>I will listen to one album on the list per run.</li>
								<li>The first time I listen to an album must be on a run. No pre-listening!</li>
								<li>After each run I'll document the run and my thoughts/experience.</li>
								<li>I won't copy code for this website</li><br><br>

        		When COVID 19 blew up, I was trying to get into shape by training for a half marathon (my third one). Of course, the race was cancelled. Everything was cancelled and my motivation tanked. I started spending my whole day at home, working at my desk and listening to music, or playing video games on the couch and listening to music. By August I noticed that I was getting out of breath walking up stairs and my body had become squishier. I came up with this project force myself to go outside, get in aerobic shape, and  develop a habit of exercising. Learning how to make a website (I am writing this website!) and becoming a culture snob are the carrot on the stick.
