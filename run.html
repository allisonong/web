								In 2020 I became a couch potato. I decided to get back in shape by running and listening to all the albums on Rolling Stones magazines list of the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-albums-of-all-time-1062063/">500 Greatest Albums of all Time</a>. I also decided to learn to code and make a website where I write about the music and my running. Welcome!

								When the Coronavirus Pandemic hit Seattle in March 2020, I was training for a half marathon and looking forward to a summer of outdoor adventures. Of course, my race was cancelled, as were many of the outdoor adventures. Thus began a year of relative isolation and living and working from the same desk. It was an emotional dumpster fire (as many have said) but one of the best things about 2020 was the new music I discovered and the way that music calmed me and gave me back the excitement missing from the rest of my life. In October I decided to use music to motivate myself to exercise and go outside again. I love music, and I hate running. But running is the cheapest, easiest, and most efficient way to get in shape. I also like learning new skills, so I decided I would learn to code and write a website myself. So, this project is a resolution to keep listening to new music, get in shape, and learn a new skill. 
							</p>
							<h3>Rules</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>I will listen to all the albums on the list!/li>
								<li>Every listen must be while running. No listening to albums on the list in advance! (exception is albums I have listened to before starting this project)</li>
								<li>After each run I'll document the run and my thoughts/experience.</li>
								<li>I won't copy and paste any code for this website</li><br><br>

        		When COVID 19 blew up, I was trying to get into shape by training for a half marathon (my third one). Of course, the race was cancelled. Everything was cancelled and my motivation tanked. I started spending my whole day at home, working at my desk and listening to music, or playing video games on the couch and listening to music. By August I noticed that I was getting out of breath walking up stairs and my body had become squishier. I came up with this project force myself to go outside, get in aerobic shape, and  develop a habit of exercising. Learning how to make a website (I am writing this website!) and becoming a culture snob are the carrot on the stick.
