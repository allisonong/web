							<h4>11/22/2020	#402 Expensive Shit - Fela Kuti and Africa 70 (1975)</h4>
							<div class="quote">
							<img src="images/expensive-shit.jpg" class="images" width="25%" align="left">
							“the Africa 70 horns blare out infectious riffs as peerless drummer Tony Allen keeps up an indefatigable shuffling pulse, while Fela calls out the “fools” who would “use your shit to put you for jail.”
							</div>
							<p>
								Expensive Shit is the second shortest album on the list at 24 minutes and 13 seconds. This was my second run and running still does not feel enjoyable. From the get go my lungs burned and my legs felt like lead. It’s a good thing that this album was awesome! Not having much experience with afrobeat or funk (the genre according to Wikipedia), I feel like I lack the vocabulary to say why I liked it. All I can say is that the rhythm was great for running, it made me want to dance, the brass was amazing. It felt straight out of Cowboy Bebop, which is one of my favorite things. On the other hand my run was beautiful and I stopped to take some photos of fall. However, running iis still hard, and I got passed by a lady pushing a stroller. Sigh.

							<h4>11/20/2020 	#410 Wild Honey - The Beach Boys (1967)</h4>
							<div class="quote">
							<img src="images/wild-honey.jpg" class="images" width="25%" align="left">
							“In 24 concise but utterly winning minutes, they romp through a set of low-fi sunbaked melodies and R&B and soul homages — all suffused with warmth, sly hooks, and a sense of band unity”. 
							</div>
							<p>
								Wild Honey is the shortest album on the list and that is exactly why I chose it for my first run. When I was a kid in Hong Kong my dad would give me his walkman and put in a Beach Boys CD (no idea which one) to occupy me. The Beach Boys I remember from childhood were a bunch of dudes crooning about California. When describing them to my husband at the dinner table, my impression consisted of a very high-pitched ‘oooooooh’ that didn’t help get my point across at all. 
							</p>
							<p>	
								As I started my run I was not into it but over the course of the 24 minutes I went from unimpressed (top 500, really?), to confused (this isn’t how I thought the Beach Boys sound), to surprised (“I’d Love Just Once to See You”), to appreciative (okay this album is pretty fun). I’d never heard the Beach Boys sound like this before. At times they sound like The Rolling Stones and at times like the Beatles. But in the end (the last track ‘Mama Says’) they became The Beach Boys as I had known them and that ended up being the track I liked best. After 24 minutes of running I was wheezing. Running is feels hard and I feel slow.<br><br>

							When the Coronavirus blew up in March 2020, I had been training for a half marathon and looking forward to many outdoor adventures. Of course, my race, like everything else, was cancelled. After months of relative isolation and working from home, I was feeling depressed, out of breath walking up stairs, and getting squishy. Through it all, music and video games were there for me. (but unlike the video games, the music didn’t eventually make me more depressed)  In October I came up with this project as a way to discover more music, force myself to get outside, exercise, and  learn a new skill (I am writing this website from scratch).
						</p>
						<h3>Rules</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>I will listen to one album on the list per run.</li>
							<li>The first time I listen to an album must be on a run. No pre-listening!</li>
							<li>After each run I'll document the run and my thoughts/experience.</li>
							<li>I can change my mind.</li>

        		In 2020 I became a couch potato. I decided to get back in shape by running and listening to all the albums on the rolling stones magazines list of 500 top albums of all time. I also decided to learn to code and make a website where I write about the music and my running. Welcome!</p>
        	<h4>The Long Version</h4>
        	<p>
        		When COVID 19 blew up, I was trying to get into shape by training for a half marathon (my third one). Of course, the race was cancelled. Everything was cancelled and my motivation tanked. I started spending my whole day at home, working at my desk and listening to music, or playing video games on the couch and listening to music. By August I noticed that I was getting out of breath walking up stairs and my body had become squishier. I came up with this project force myself to go outside, get in aerobic shape, and  develop a habit of exercising. Learning how to make a website (I am writing this website!) and becoming a culture snob are the carrot on the stick.
