								In 2020 I became a couch potato.

								When the Coronavirus blew up in March 2020, I had been training for a half marathon and looking forward to many outdoor adventures. Of course, my race, like everything else, was cancelled. After months of relative isolation and working from home, I was feeling depressed, out of breath walking up stairs, and getting squishy. Through it all, music and video games were there for me. (but unlike the video games, the music didn’t eventually make me more depressed)  In October I came up with this project as a way to discover more music, force myself to get outside, exercise, and  learn a new skill (I am writing this website from scratch).

							<h3>Rules</h3>
							<ol>
								<li>I will listen to one album on the list per run.</li>
								<li>The first time I listen to an album must be on a run. No pre-listening!</li>
								<li>After each run I'll document the run and my thoughts/experience.</li>
								<li>I can change my mind.</li>

        		When COVID 19 blew up, I was trying to get into shape by training for a half marathon (my third one). Of course, the race was cancelled. Everything was cancelled and my motivation tanked. I started spending my whole day at home, working at my desk and listening to music, or playing video games on the couch and listening to music. By August I noticed that I was getting out of breath walking up stairs and my body had become squishier. I came up with this project force myself to go outside, get in aerobic shape, and  develop a habit of exercising. Learning how to make a website (I am writing this website!) and becoming a culture snob are the carrot on the stick.
