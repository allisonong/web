How could a committed runner/blogger allow their phone to die in the middle of a critical run? Let me tell you: it was my first time running on snow and in a blizzard, and my phone died because it was very cold. How was running to Metallica during a snow blizzard? Let me tell you: it was awesome. So, because I didn’t finish listening last week, I started it from scratch on a different run this week. I think that by the end of the album I was a little over the whole loud-guitars-really-fast thing, but at the beginning it was pretty great. There are a few songs where they start out sounding very folk rock or soft rock and then suddenly they switch gears and it really gets the blood pumping. It is hard to pay attention to or understand what they are saying, but the guitar parts and the drum parts sure are nice. There is nothing quite like running to metallica and getting passed by a family of five (mom running while holding dog on a leash, child on a bicycle, and dad pushing baby in a stroller). It all feels very badass. ",

I think I probably need to listen to it again because, as someone who’s used to listening to music with words, this album was the soundtrack and prompt for my thoughts. Meaning, what I remember about this run most are the things I thought about. This album has four tracks sharing the name of the album but with pt I Acknowledgement, pt II Resolution, pt III Pursuance, pt IV Psalm. I found this titling really curious so I tried to think about these topics as the tracks played. I started my run thinking about acknowledgement and the things I could/should acknowledge. It occurred to me that the songs were like little one word poems with musical prompts to guide your experience. (Actually the first track is a four word poem since Coltrane shouts ‘A Love Supreme!’ a few times towards the end). It was a new experience for me, to run and think intentionally about something. It was kindof meditative. I liked it. It felt like a sonic journey.",

I keep having these moments where I am surprised when albums on this list are really good. I am embarrassed to admit that I haven’t listened to this artist before. Despite having listened to a lot of Joni Mitchell and seeking out women artists from the 70’s, I am pretty sure my high school self listened to one or two of Janis Joplin’s songs and decided they were country. Anyways I was wrong. I have heard great things about her and I was still unprepared for the vocals and soul and blues and rhythms and beats that came out of this album. What a joy to run to. Speaking of running being a joy, I am settling into my weekday 3 mile runs. The runs themselves no longer induce dread, although it still takes me 30 minutes to an hour to get myself out the door.",

I thought about how I grew up in a Beatles culture, so it’s easy to take them for granted. I also thought about how I had compared them to two modern artists, which was maybe unfair. But I have to say, I find it hard to imagine someone who grew up listening to Aretha ever being sick or underwhelmed by her. And this album came out less than 10 years after A Hard Day’s Night and yet it has all of the complexity the former lacks. There are many types of songs, from funk to soul to jazz. There are a range of sounds from horns to piano to gospel choir. The lyrical content includes the standard love songs, but also songs about lifting up the youth in your community or just grooving to music. There’s rhythmic variation above the standard 4x4, rhyme on every last word, formula. There’s drama! The songs have a beginning, a middle, and an end. There is buildup, there is tension, there is release. There is emotion! When Aretha sings, you feel something! The majority of the songs on A Hard Day’s Night are sung in this sortof monotone that makes it seem like the Beatles themselves are bored while singing. So, in conclusion, this album was amazing and better than A Hard Day’s Night by the Beatles.",

		"text":"I am going to be controversial and be negative about a Beatles album. I understand that the Beatles have influenced most modern music and that I am taking for granted things they did that were awesome and new at the time. I’m just speaking on my experience running to this album in 2021. There was a time in my life (before puberty) when I appreciated the aches of simple desires, like wanting to hold hands or having a crush. However, right now older Beatles songs are a little uninteresting to me. Firstly, the songs are about super simple ideas. If Kid Cudi addresses depression, anxiety, family, drug use, and existential crisis in one song, then a song about being happy to dance with someone feels a little boring. When MF Doom is making multi-word, multi-syllable rhymes, often repeating in one line or spanning multiple stanzas, then forgive me if rhyming ‘dog’ with ‘log’ and ‘tight’ with ‘night’ feels a little unimpressive. As I was running, I noticed that I could predict the last word of every other line, because the lyrics and rhymes were so predictable. The song that stood out the most was ‘Can’t Buy me Love’, because the beat between ‘I don’t care too’ and ‘much for money’ was interesting and unexpected. I am looking forward to the albums where the Beatles get less wholesome.  I would like to say, with regard to my running, that I have officially reached the point where running no longer feels horrible. In fact, it’s starting to feel like no big deal to do 3 miles. So, that’s great!",

I still don’t know how to describe what I just listened to. I think this is a style of music I have very little experience with. This album has parts that feel disney (especially because of the orchestral backing), a lot of it feels Billy Joel, sometimes it feels like Day Tripper Beatles, and then there’s some Tom Waits grit. I think what is the most fun about this type of music is the atmospheric storytelling. Each song feels like a story that you’re overhearing in a dimly lit American bar. I decided that this should be an ‘chill’ run and deliberately slowed it down. I was surprised to see that my ‘chill’ pace was a lot faster than my ‘struggle’ pace had been a few weeks ago. But this is probably also due to the fact that I set my app to cut out the time that I spend waiting for stop lights.

I don’t remember where I was going but I remember putting my earbuds in and being progressively more and more impressed as the album progressed. First of all, the album is narrated by Common, who is probably the best bedtime story reader in the world. Cudi is so relatable singing about pain, solitude, depression, introspection and staying awake all night alone in your bedroom. There are many lyrics from this album that get stuck in my head; ‘the moon will illuminate my room and soon I’m consumed by my doom’ (basically how I spent high school). But even with the songs about depression and loneliness, Cudi is also clever, cocky, and optimistic about the future. He’s an underdog you can relate to. Sonically, this album is super pleasing as well. The layers of futuristic, psychedelic, dream sounds about as worthy of Daft Punk as it gets, without being Daft Punk. I would listen to the music of this album without the lyrics. To me this is about as good as it gets. One of my favorites of all time. Oh, and I ran the longest and fastest I have since I started this project :P. ",

		"text":"Wow. As soon as this album started I had one of those moments where I felt the loss of not having listened to this before. I would have put this album a lot higher up on the list, and it definitely wins for best album cover so far. Firstly, the Rolling Stones is right, Madlib’s production is some of the best I’ve heard. A word that comes to mind is ‘craft’. Unfortunately, the Rolling Stones is also right that MF Doom’s (RIP) rhymes require a second, third, fourth etc. listen for them to penetrate. I’ve listened to this album twice so far, and I’m overwhelmed by the rhymes within rhymes, the multisyllable/multiword rhymes, the internal rhymes, the rhymes that cross from one verse to another, the deadpan jokes, good god! What I can comment on for now is that I love an album that tells a story and, while this one doesn’t in the narrative sense, it creates a character and a mythology around the character. There are also several non-lyrical fun interludes that add depth to the feeling/atmosphere of this album. Ask me about the lyrics again in ten years. I had another nice, easy run, on a flat loop around a canal. Running on flat ground definitely feels casual now, which is encouraging.

While I still don’t know, I think it has to do with a fast beat, loud music, and singing as if you’re talking very loud. I’m not sure I liked it, but didn’t dislike it either. There are some clever tracks and lines, like ‘your phone’s off the hook, but you’re not’. However, I am kindof surprised that this is relatively high on the list (top half). Perhaps as I keep listening this will just be a common feeling with the genre's I'm less accustomed to. It's also possible that my lack of enthusiasm about this album also had to do with the fact that I had recently had food poisoning and hadn’t eaten much for the last few days. I felt 80 years old on this run. And not like the wiry 80 year olds who I once saw running a marathon in the Alps. Maybe when this is all over I’ll find out what punk rock is all about.",

Mariah delivers lines about pain and heartbreak as if she’s genuinely in her feelings, but also in lingerie leaning out of the balcony of her sleek and modern apartment overlooking the LA skyline. There were moments during this run where I wanted to close my eyes and clutch my chest with my hands. So, I guess there’s a reason why she’s considered a legend.

My sister is a Gen Zer, so I assumed she knew all these songs.  So after telling her how much I enjoyed this album, I texted her “I like treat people with kindness”. To which she responded “yeah?”.

Whoa there. As a skeptical, ‘woke’, 21st century person, I had to listen to this album with a grain of salt. Cool style, cool song, cool sounds. How much of that is Elvis and how much of it was ‘borrowed’ from was called ‘negro music’ at the time? Even pushing the questionable appropriation aside, I found the lyrical content a little boring. It not that exciting to run while reflecting meaningfully on how lucky a fella is who finds a woman who saves all her lovin’ for him or who knows a woman’s place is right there in her home. I guess I will give Elvis a little credit for popularizing rock and roll, but I probably need to listen to Bo Diddley before giving Elvis all the credit. Unfortunately the Bo Diddley album on this list is actually two albums, and 60 minutes long, so I have to increase my endurance before educating myself more about the origins of rock and roll. My run suuucked. I think I was just going through the motions of running, and probably would have felt better about myself if I had just power-walked through this one.",

The stories were good, the singing was good, and I was surprised to enjoy the music quite a bit.

I also couldn’t help but think that singing about 17 year olds and trying to seduce someone with the line “Little child little child, won't you dance with me? I'm so sad and lonely” is a little creepy. The description for this album on the Rolling Stone’s list makes me suspicious that it’s on the list more for its historical importance more than for the actual quality of the album.",

From the get go my lungs burned and my legs felt like lead. It’s a good thing that this album was awesome! Not having much experience with afrobeat or funk (the genre according to Wikipedia), I feel like I lack the vocabulary to say why I liked it. All I can say is that the rhythm was great for running, it made me want to dance, the brass was amazing. It felt straight out of Cowboy Bebop, which is one of my favorite things. On the other hand my run was beautiful and I stopped to take some photos of fall. However, running is still hard, and I got passed by a lady pushing a stroller. Sigh.",

		"text":"When I was a kid in Hong Kong my dad would give me his walkman to occupy me on hikes. My preferred CD at the time was some Beach Boys compilation album. The Beach Boys, as I knew them in my childhood, sang cheesy songs about California in high-pitched falsettos. As I started my run I was confused. This didn’t sound like the Beach Boys I’d known. But eventually my surprise wore off and I found myself enjoying the music. I even did the audio equivalent of a double-take when lyrics from “I’d Love Just Once to See You” gave me a little shock. This album sounded to me like old Rolling Stones or Beatles. On the very  last track, ‘Mama Says’, they return to the crooning falsettos and became The Beach Boys as I had known them. It turns out that is how I like them best. I chose this album to run to first because it is the shortest and I am weak. After 24 minutes of running I was wheezing. Damn.",
