A bunch of young white guys being jerks? In any case \”Some Girls\” is a long list of unflattering stereotypes about women that fails to be as charming as some other lists (I’m thinking of one by the Beach Boys). As Keith goes through his list (Italian girls want cars, English girls talk too much, Black women just want to be fucked all night, American girls want everything under the sun, white girls are funny) my eyebrows moved progressively higher up my forehead. He ends this list with Chinese girls (hello) who are ‘gentle’. Sounds like none of the Rolling Stones have ever been to a cosmetician in Chinatown. (That was a joke and Chinese women, like all people, can be both gentle and not gentle. GOODNESS) \”Beast of Burden\” is indeed a really great song, but the rest of the songs on this album were fun to listen to, but two days later I don’t remember them. I think in the end my feeling is that there are plenty of really good songs by The Rolling Stones that I will listen to in the future. \”Beast of Burden\” is one of them, but none of the other songs on this album are.",

But the music jumps from genre to genre including pop, blues, country (honky tonk is the word that came to mind, but I’m not sure I really know what that is), r&b, reggae. I think the crazy genre bending made this album feel a little confusing to listen to as a whole, but I was impressed by the title track \”Nick of Time\” which is a song about watching your parents getting old, and then realizing that you’re getting old too. Yep, I feel that. How is my running going? Okay. I am still running but I haven’t gotten to that point where going on a long run feels good.",

The even keel of the music made it really easy to set a chill pace and keep it going. The album is a soul classic, sounds like a soul classic, but the lyrical content felt surprisingly sad to me. \”Have you been making out okay\” felt sweet and sad, especially after a year of social distancing and not keeping up with people I care about.  \”I’m so Lonesome I Could cry\” (which apparently is a cover) is really sad, especially after a year of social distancing and spending loads of time alone. \”Funny How the Time Slips Away\” also felt a little too real and sad, especially after realizing how long it's been since I’ve seen some of my favorite people.  So, I guess what I’ll say is that the music and singing is very smooth and cool, but the lyrics sure were melancholy. It’s a weird contrast and I don’t know exactly what to make of it.  My favorite tracks were \”Here I am, Come and Take me\” and the last track, \”Jesus is Waiting\”. Both were more along the lines of what I expected - funky and fresh, something to groove to.",

Turns out all the GN’R hits are on this album, including \”Sweet Child of Mine\” and \”Paradise City\”. Those three songs are so damn good, almost perfect songs, that are exciting, dramatic, and emotional. My blood was pumping and I felt excited to be alive and excited to be running outside. Those songs are so well structured with a range of sounds and musical parts (bridges and guitar solos) that are all interesting and well paced so that the song never gets boring. What a killer of an album. Unfortunately this run turned into an anger run (third one in a year!) where running releases my pent up emotions about shitty things like racism and senseless violence. So, somewhere during the second mile I found myself gasping for air either from pushing it too hard or feeling all my feelings or both. The good news is I managed my huffing and puffing and didn’t have to stop running.  I’m sure I’m not the only person this happens to.  I was surprised that this turned  into an anger run (it is no RTJ4) but I guess the music resonated with me, got some emotions/adrenaline going, and unlocked my box of emotions I try not to feel too often. I think overall it’s good to go on an anger run every so often. So, I am grateful to Guns n Roses for helping me get some release.",

No strong feelings about this one. I was also surprised by the sound of the first few songs - I guess they’re celebrating the sixties at its campiest. They felt almost like the early Beatles style. Wikipedia puts the genre of this album as punk rock, which means I still don’t know what punk is supposed to sound like. The whole album was fun to run to, but none of the songs stood out to me in particular except one which had me double-take at my phone.

This one feels like it deserves to be right up where it is at the 100 line. It’s truly mind blowing that this is the first album from some friends straight out of high school. The album is framed by the audio to a fictional game show, where no one wins. I remember when Janelle Monae’s album Electric Lady came out, I thought it was super creative and original to include several tracks of a fictional radio show between songs to act like the greek chorus to her operatic album. After listening to Madvillainy and 3 Feet High and Rising, I now know that’s a hip hop tradition. The sounds and samples and stories and jokes on this album are super fresh, and just entertaining and fun to run to. I particularly loved the song \”Tread Water\” which was a potent reminder in the middle of my longest run so far, to just keep going. But it also felt relevant to life during a pandemic, a reckoning/apex of racial violence, an siege to a federal building in DC, and what else.

I grew up with Britney and \"Baby one more time\" and \"Oops I did it Again\" are some of my first memories of owning my own cds in elementary school. In college my friends and I revered BritBrit as our queen. But with all that said, I’m not sure why this album out of her whole discography is on this list. I feel like the albums I just mentioned are already better and more certain of sound than this techno-pop extravaganza. Maybe all the people who voted for this to be on the list are producers who get a lot more out of computery robot sounds than I do (and yet I love daft punk). The only songs that really stood out to me were Gimme More, Piece of Me (which I love), and On My Radar (but only because I’ve watched the music video multiple times).  The rest all blended together. So, post-run I checked out the wikipedia page for this album and was shocked by how mean the reviews quoted were towards Britney. They all had something to say about how \"even if Britney is not fully with it, at least she knows to hire the best\". I guess people were mean in the 90’s/early aughts. It’s totally true that what people said about her, they would not be able to get away with now. Oh and one more thing - this is probably the worst album cover so far.",

Let me tell you: it was awesome. So, because I didn’t finish listening last week, I started it from scratch on a different run this week. I think that by the end of the album I was a little over the whole loud-guitars-really-fast thing, but at the beginning it was pretty great. There are a few songs where they start out sounding very folk rock or soft rock and then suddenly they switch gears and it really gets the blood pumping. It is hard to pay attention to or understand what they are saying, but the guitar parts and the drum parts sure are nice. There is nothing quite like running to metallica and getting passed by a family of five (mom running while holding dog on a leash, child on a bicycle, and dad pushing baby in a stroller).

This album has four tracks sharing the name of the album but with pt I Acknowledgement, pt II Resolution, pt III Pursuance, pt IV Psalm. I found this titling really curious so I tried to think about these topics as the tracks played. I started my run thinking about acknowledgement and the things I could/should acknowledge. It occurred to me that the songs were like little one word poems with musical prompts to guide your experience.

Despite having listened to a lot of Joni Mitchell and seeking out women artists from the 70’s, I am pretty sure my high school self listened to one or two of Janis Joplin’s songs and decided they were country.

I thought about how I grew up in a Beatles culture, so it’s easy to take them for granted. I also thought about how I had compared them to two modern artists, which was maybe unfair. But I have to say, I find it hard to imagine someone who grew up listening to Aretha ever being sick or underwhelmed by her. And this album came out less than 10 years after A Hard Day’s Night and yet it has all of the complexity the former lacks. There are many types of songs, from funk to soul to jazz. There are a range of sounds from horns to piano to gospel choir. The lyrical content includes the standard love songs, but also songs about lifting up the youth in your community or just grooving to music. There’s rhythmic variation above the standard 4x4, rhyme on every last word, formula. There’s drama! The songs have a beginning, a middle, and an end. There is buildup, there is tension, there is release. There is emotion! When Aretha sings, you feel something! The majority of the songs on A Hard Day’s Night are sung in this sortof monotone that makes it seem like the Beatles themselves are bored while singing.

I understand that the Beatles have influenced most modern music and that I am taking for granted things they did that were awesome and new at the time. I’m just speaking on my experience running to this album in 2021. There was a time in my life (before puberty) when I appreciated the aches of simple desires, like wanting to hold hands or having a crush. However, right now older Beatles songs are a little uninteresting to me. Firstly, the songs are about super simple ideas. If Kid Cudi addresses depression, anxiety, family, drug use, and existential crisis in one song, then a song about being happy to dance with someone feels a little boring. When MF Doom is making multi-word, multi-syllable rhymes, often repeating in one line or spanning multiple stanzas, then forgive me if rhyming ‘dog’ with ‘log’ and ‘tight’ with ‘night’ feels a little unimpressive. As I was running, I noticed that I could predict the last word of every other line, because the lyrics and rhymes were so predictable. The song that stood out the most was ‘Can’t Buy me Love’, because the beat between ‘I don’t care too’ and ‘much for money’ was interesting and unexpected. I am looking forward to the albums where the Beatles get less wholesome.  I would like to say, with regard to my running, that I have officially reached the point where running no longer feels horrible. In fact, it’s starting to feel like no big deal to do 3 miles.

This album has parts that feel disney (especially because of the orchestral backing), a lot of it feels Billy Joel, sometimes it feels like Day Tripper Beatles, and then there’s some Tom Waits grit. I think what is the most fun about this type of music is the atmospheric storytelling. Each song feels like a story that you’re overhearing in a dimly lit American bar. I decided that this should be an ‘chill’ run and deliberately slowed it down. I was surprised to see that my ‘chill’ pace was a lot faster than my ‘struggle’ pace had been a few weeks ago.

First of all, the album is narrated by Common, who is probably the best bedtime story reader in the world. Cudi is so relatable singing about pain, solitude, depression, introspection and staying awake all night alone in your bedroom. There are many lyrics from this album that get stuck in my head; ‘the moon will illuminate my room and soon I’m consumed by my doom’ (basically how I spent high school). But even with the songs about depression and loneliness, Cudi is also clever, cocky, and optimistic about the future. He’s an underdog you can relate to. Sonically, this album is super pleasing as well. The layers of futuristic, psychedelic, dream sounds about as worthy of Daft Punk as it gets, without being Daft Punk.

I’ve listened to this album twice so far, and I’m overwhelmed by the rhymes within rhymes, the multisyllable/multiword rhymes, the internal rhymes, the rhymes that cross from one verse to another, the deadpan jokes, good god! What I can comment on for now is that I love an album that tells a story and, while this one doesn’t in the narrative sense, it creates a character and a mythology around the character. There are also several non-lyrical fun interludes that add depth to the feeling/atmosphere of this album. Ask me about the lyrics again in ten years.

My sister is a Gen Zer, so I assumed she knew all these songs.  So after telling her how much I enjoyed this album, I texted her “I like treat people with kindness”. To which she responded “yeah?”. Turns out she didn’t know the song which means I’m definitively more hip than she is. On this day I tried to do 3 x 1 mile intervals. After the second interval I became very discouraged due to my phone not tracking my running well and telling me I was running at a 17 minute pace, when in fact I was running as fast as I could.",

It especially picks up halfway through at ‘Space Invader’. My favorite parts were the instrumentals that had me feeling dreamy - like lying in a meadow, looking at the sky, and feeling one level above it all. I was also pretty entertained by the two songs about having a total lack of empathy, “Stop Your Sobbing” (which apparently is a Ramones cover) and “Private Life” (in which Hynde sings about how she wants nothing to do with your private life drama, keep me out). I think I’m finally feeling like running is not terrible, painful, and embarrassing.",

I can’t believe my parents and teachers let me walk around high school not knowing my t-shirt was a parody of a famous album cover. I have never intentionally listened to Elvis, though I have heard his songs on the radio, in movies, on playlists etc. According to Spotify he ‘may be the single most important figure in 20th-century popular music’. Whoa there. As a skeptical, ‘woke’, 21st century person, I had to listen to this album with a grain of salt. Cool style, cool song, cool sounds. How much of that is Elvis and how much of it was ‘borrowed’ from was called ‘negro music’ at the time? Even pushing the questionable appropriation aside, I found the lyrical content a little boring. It not that exciting to run while reflecting meaningfully on how lucky a fella is who finds a woman who saves all her lovin’ for him or who knows a woman’s place is right there in her home. I guess I will give Elvis a little credit for popularizing rock and roll, but I probably need to listen to Bo Diddley before giving Elvis all the credit. Unfortunately the Bo Diddley album on this list is actually two albums, and 60 minutes long, so I have to increase my endurance before educating myself more about the origins of rock and roll. My run suuucked. I think I was just going through the motions of running, and probably would have felt better about myself if I had just power-walked through this one.",

It is full of catchy and pop hits, and several songs surprised me with prominent drum beats that were great to run to. I felt like I was riding Adele’s emotional rollercoaster while running around my city. Did I tear up when I got to ‘Someone like you’? Ask me sometime about emotional running. All that being said, most of the albums I really liked, I ended up listening to multiple times. This is one of the few that I really loved in the moment, but haven’t found myself returning to.  I took a week off from running because I was feeling a little under the weather. When I finally felt better I decided it’s time to start increasing my distance on weekends.

I guess Loretta Lynn is sortof a cornerstone of Country (especially women in country) and I think I can see why. The stories she tells are like americana folktales. Titular song, Coal Miner’s Daughter, reminded me a lot of Coat of Many Colors, and I liked it about as much. However, the rest of the album is not as good since half the songs are about being cheated on and cheating. As I ran I saw myself as a jilted wife, with huge blond curls, waiting on the porch with a shotgun for my no-good man to come home from drinking.I had a good run! I realized this run that there is a strong correlation between how good I feel based on whether I run downhill to the flat streets, or if I run uphill to the hilly streets. Go figure.",

I can’t help but feel that this album could have been left out of the list for another (maybe contemporary!?!) album. In case you’re wondering, the Beach Boys are featured on the list 3 times. Perhaps that’s one time too many? Music snobs, come at me bros. Ran the flat route again but running is still hard! When will it stop feeling like I am forcing my muscles to move?

There was a podcast about here (Dolly Parton’s America, highly recommend), she was in the news a lot (thanks Dolly for funding a coronavirus vaccine), and she released a christmas album (which I won’t listen to). As I learned more about Dolly I’ve been humbled for having previously judged her for her appearance and country designation. I won’t wax about Dolly but if you still think she’s a weirdo Barbie, then maybe listen to the podcast. Listening to Coat of Many Colors after Dirty Mind was pretty awesome. It’s another album where each song tells a story, and there were plenty of surprises along the way. I enjoyed the title track, ‘Traveling Man’, and ‘She Never Met a Man (She Didn’t Like)’. The stories were good, the singing was good, and I was surprised to enjoy the music quite a bit. This album felt like homey to me, which is probably due to Dolly’s roots in Appalachian folk music (why do I associate that with homey-ness is a question for my therapist, once I get one). I will probably listen to this again. This time, instead of running uphill from my house, I went downhill. The downhill route eventually leads to a flat road I can run on.

I tend to love albums that tell stories and this was like a book of short stories. Each song was bangin’, funky, energetic, and told a story that was compelling and often surprising. The songs that stood out were ‘Dirty mind’, ‘When you were mine’, and ‘Uptown’.  It was so much good energy that I accidentally ran further than I meant to, and when the album ended I found myself pretty far away from home.

This album is has a lot of good songs but the ones that really stick are “I wanna hold your hand”, “I saw her standing there”, and “All my loving’”. Listening in 2020, it was a little boring that the songs are all about making someone belong to you, or wanting to belong to someone else. I also couldn’t help but think that singing about 17 year olds and trying to seduce someone with the line “Little child little child, won't you dance with me? I'm so sad and lonely” is a little creepy.

This album sounded to me like old Rolling Stones or Beatles. On the very  last track, ‘Mama Says’, they return to the crooning falsettos and became The Beach Boys as I had known them. It turns out that is how I like them best. I chose this album to run to first because it is the shortest and I am weak. After 24 minutes of running I was wheezing. Damn.",
