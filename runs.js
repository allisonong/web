		"quote":"Madlib provides a shifting bed of warped funk and wildly unpredictable samples, drawing on everything from Thunder and Lightning’s “Bumpin’ Bus Stop” to “The Theme of the Justice League of America.” Doom’s rhymes are so casually adventurous that sometimes it takes a second to notice how stunning they are.",
		"text":"Wow. As soon as this album started I had one of those moments where I felt the loss of not having listened to this before. I would have put this album a lot higher up on the list, and it definitely wins for best album cover so far. Firstly, the Rolling Stones is right, Madlib’s production is some of the best I’ve heard. A word that comes to mind is ‘craft’. Unfortunately, the Rolling Stones is also right that MF Doom’s (RIP) rhymes require a second, third, fourth etc. listen for them to penetrate. I’ve listened to this album twice so far, and I’m overwhelmed by the rhymes within rhymes, the multisyllable/multiword rhymes, the internal rhymes, the rhymes that cross from one verse to another, the deadpan jokes, good god! What I can comment on for now is that I love an album that tells a story and, while this one doesn’t in the narrative sense, it creates a character and a mythology around the character. There are also several non-lyrical fun interludes that add depth to the feeling/atmosphere of this album. Ask me about the lyrics again in ten years. I had another nice, easy run, on a flat loop around a canal. Running on flat ground definitely feels casual now, which is encouraging. However, running in the hilly terrain of my neighborhood does not yet feel casual.",

		"text":"\"What is punk rock?\” is what I kept wondering as I ran to this album. While I still don’t know, I think it has to do with a fast beat, loud music, and singing as if you’re talking very loud. I’m not sure I liked it, but didn’t dislike it either. There are some clever tracks and lines, like ‘your phone’s off the hook, but you’re not’. However, I am kindof surprised that this is relatively high on the list (top half). Perhaps as I keep listening this will just be a common feeling with the genre's I'm less accustomed to. It's also possible that my lack of enthusiasm about this album also had to do with the fact that I had recently had food poisoning and hadn’t eaten much for the last few days. I felt 80 years old on this run. And not like the wiry 80 year olds who I once saw running a marathon in the Alps. Maybe when this is all over I’ll find out what punk rock is all about.",

		"text":"Gosh. As soon as I started my run I was really into this album. I guess I really am a 90’s child. How is it that I’ve never listened to Mariah Carey before? I don’t think I’ve ever heard being vulnerable sound so sexy. Mariah delivers lines about pain and heartbreak as if she’s genuinely in her feelings, but also in lingerie leaning out of the balcony of her sleek and modern apartment overlooking the LA skyline. There were moments during this run where I wanted to close my eyes and clutch my chest with my hands. So, I guess there’s a reason why she’s considered a legend. I enjoyed this album so much I think it made me run faster. I ran my usual 4.5 mile loop but found myself at the end before the album was over. So I kept running until the music ended, and accidentally ran my longest run. YEET",

		"text":"This came out so recently, they still play songs from it on the radio! I feel relevant! Also, I loved it and have listened to it many times after this run. I thought I heard some Beatles and Elton John influences. While it definitely draws from the 70’s a lot, it still feels contemporary in a timeless way. If that makes sense. I think what I want to say is that Harry Styles hasn’t made anything new, but he’s made something old feel new. My favorite songs are ‘Watermelon Sugar’ and ‘Treat People with Kindness”. My sister is a Gen Zer, so I assumed she knew all these songs.  So after telling her how much I enjoyed this album, I texted her “I like treat people with kindness”. To which she responded “yeah?”. Turns out she didn’t know the song which means I’m definitively more hip than she is. On this day I tried to do 3 x 1 mile intervals. After the second interval I became very discouraged due to my phone not tracking my running well and telling me I was running at a 17 minute pace, when in fact I was running as fast as I could.",

It especially picks up halfway through at ‘Space Invader’. My favorite parts were the instrumentals that had me feeling dreamy - like lying in a meadow, looking at the sky, and feeling one level above it all. I was also pretty entertained by the two songs about having a total lack of empathy, “Stop Your Sobbing” (which apparently is a Ramones cover) and “Private Life” (in which Hynde sings about how she wants nothing to do with your private life drama, keep me out). I think I’m finally feeling like running is not terrible, painful, and embarrassing.",

		"text":"I recognized the album cover from a t-shirt I had in high school, but with a monkey in Elvis’ place. I can’t believe my parents and teachers let me walk around high school not knowing my t-shirt was a parody of a famous album cover. I have never intentionally listened to Elvis, though I have heard his songs on the radio, in movies, on playlists etc. According to Spotify he ‘may be the single most important figure in 20th-century popular music’. Whoa there. As a skeptical, ‘woke’, 21st century person, I had to listen to this album with a grain of salt. Cool style, cool song, cool sounds. How much of that is Elvis and how much of it was ‘borrowed’ from was called ‘negro music’ at the time? Even pushing the questionable appropriation aside, I found the lyrical content a little boring. It not that exciting to run while reflecting meaningfully on how lucky a fella is who finds a woman who saves all her lovin’ for him or who knows a woman’s place is right there in her home. I guess I will give Elvis a little credit for popularizing rock and roll, but I probably need to listen to Bo Diddley before giving Elvis all the credit. Unfortunately the Bo Diddley album on this list is actually two albums, and 60 minutes long, so I have to increase my endurance before educating myself more about the origins of rock and roll. My run suuucked. I think I was just going through the motions of running, and probably would have felt better about myself if I had just power-walked through this one.",

She’d actually cut an entire album with producer Rick Rubin but wound up preferring earlier demos of songs like “Rolling in the Deep,” “Someone Like You,” and “Set Fire to the Rain,” and mostly used those instead. The switch-up made for an even rawer and more emotional experience that clearly connected: 21 sold more than 30 million copies and swept the 2012 Grammys",
		"text":"Two songs from this album were performed by my roommates in acapella groups (yes multiple roommates in multiple acapella groups). Despite that fact, I had never listened to this album before. It was great and I thoroughly enjoyed running to it. It is full of catchy and pop hits, and several songs surprised me with prominent drum beats that were great to run to. I felt like I was riding Adele’s emotional rollercoaster while running around my city. Did I tear up when I got to ‘Someone like you’? Ask me sometime about emotional running. All that being said, most of the albums I really liked, I ended up listening to multiple times. This is one of the few that I really loved in the moment, but haven’t found myself returning to.  I took a week off from running because I was feeling a little under the weather. When I finally felt better I decided it’s time to start increasing my distance on weekends. I did a nice flat loop and felt good.",

		"text":"In middle school, I wrote on my myspace that I listened to “anything except rap and country”. I started listening to rap about two years later but it has taken me til now (decades later) to get over the stereotypes about country music. For a long time I thought that country music was songs like ‘Drunk on a Plane’ and “Girls Love Country Boys’, which are like death in my ears. I guess Loretta Lynn is sortof a cornerstone of Country (especially women in country) and I think I can see why. The stories she tells are like americana folktales. Titular song, Coal Miner’s Daughter, reminded me a lot of Coat of Many Colors, and I liked it about as much. However, the rest of the album is not as good since half the songs are about being cheated on and cheating. As I ran I saw myself as a jilted wife, with huge blond curls, waiting on the porch with a shotgun for my no-good man to come home from drinking.I had a good run! I realized this run that there is a strong correlation between how good I feel based on whether I run downhill to the flat streets, or if I run uphill to the hilly streets. Go figure.",

		"text":"This was probably my least favorite album so far. Compared to Wild Honey, this one felt more monotonous in style and sound. The songs blended together and seemed mostly to be about relationships, again. I thought I’d give the album another chance and on a second listen I felt essentially the same about it. I can’t help but feel that this album could have been left out of the list for another (maybe contemporary!?!) album. In case you’re wondering, the Beach Boys are featured on the list 3 times. Perhaps that’s one time too many? Music snobs, come at me bros. Ran the flat route again but running is still hard! When will it stop feeling like I am forcing my muscles to move? I know that in theory I will be one day running to longer albums (this one was 28 minutes long) but right now it doesn’t feel like I’ll get there.",

I did appreciate the sound of it, the clapping, the catchy tunes, but I think that the lyrics probably add a lot to this album that completely went over my head. I did have a fun moment where the sound of my footsteps running synced up to the clapping sounds of a song. This is a run I forced myself to do after waking up in a bad mood and feeling generally out of it. I went back to the uphill route from my house and it felt like a slog.",

There was a podcast about here (Dolly Parton’s America, highly recommend), she was in the news a lot (thanks Dolly for funding a coronavirus vaccine), and she released a christmas album (which I won’t listen to). As I learned more about Dolly I’ve been humbled for having previously judged her for her appearance and country designation. I won’t wax about Dolly but if you still think she’s a weirdo Barbie, then maybe listen to the podcast. Listening to Coat of Many Colors after Dirty Mind was pretty awesome. It’s another album where each song tells a story, and there were plenty of surprises along the way. I enjoyed the title track, ‘Traveling Man’, and ‘She Never Met a Man (She Didn’t Like)’. The stories were good, the singing was good, and I was surprised to enjoy the music quite a bit. This album felt like homey to me, which is probably due to Dolly’s roots in Appalachian folk music (why do I associate that with homey-ness is a question for my therapist, once I get one). I will probably listen to this again. This time, instead of running uphill from my house, I went downhill. The downhill route eventually leads to a flat road I can run on. My average pace was a minute faster than it has been up until now! HA.",

So many of my favorite artists were influenced by Prince (Janelle Monae and Lizzo) that I’ve been long overdue when it comes to listening to Prince. The first thing in my notes from after the run is ‘Wow’. This was my favorite out of the albums I’ve listened to so far. I tend to love albums that tell stories and this was like a book of short stories. Each song was bangin’, funky, energetic, and told a story that was compelling and often surprising. The songs that stood out were ‘Dirty mind’, ‘When you were mine’, and ‘Uptown’.  It was so much good energy that I accidentally ran further than I meant to, and when the album ended I found myself pretty far away from home.

It was easy listening and great for jogging slowly around the neighborhood, feeling fine. I think I can remember being a preschooler in Tokyo and singing “I want to hold your hand” in the car while holding my parents’ hands. This album is has a lot of good songs but the ones that really stick are “I wanna hold your hand”, “I saw her standing there”, and “All my loving’”. Listening in 2020, it was a little boring that the songs are all about making someone belong to you, or wanting to belong to someone else. I also couldn’t help but think that singing about 17 year olds and trying to seduce someone with the line “Little child little child, won't you dance with me? I'm so sad and lonely” is a little creepy.

Not having much experience with afrobeat or funk (the genre according to Wikipedia), I feel like I lack the vocabulary to say why I liked it.

The Beach Boys, as I knew them in my childhood, sang cheesy songs about California in high-pitched falsettos. As I started my run I was confused. This didn’t sound like the Beach Boys I’d known. But eventually my surprise wore off and I found myself enjoying the music. I even did the audio equivalent of a double-take when lyrics from “I’d Love Just Once to See You” gave me a little shock. This album sounded to me like old Rolling Stones or Beatles. On the very  last track, ‘Mama Says’, they return to the crooning falsettos and became The Beach Boys as I had known them. It turns out that is how I like them best. I chose this album to run to first because it is the shortest and I am weak. After 24 minutes of running I was wheezing. Damn.",
